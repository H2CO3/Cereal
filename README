Explanation: this tweak is cut into two parts as the two dylibs has to be loaded separately: the client (which gets notified by libactivator)
has to be loaded into SpringBoard, the server (which performs the actual actions) has to be loaded into the DragonDictation app.
The client and the server communicate via CPDitributedMessagingCenter.
